PASSWORD HACKER

This is a project in Jetbrains Academy, Python Developer curriculum.
It consists of 5 stages.This piece of code is the final product.

DESCRIPTION

Your program has successfully. You've been spotted: the admin noticed your first failed attempts, found the vulnerability and made a patch. You should overcome this patch and hack the system again. It’s not easy being a hacker!

The admin has improved the server: the program now catches the exception and sends a simple ‘wrong password’ message to the client even when the real password starts with current symbols.

But here's the thing: the admin probably just caught this exception. We know that catching an exception takes the computer a long time, so there should be a delay in the server response when this exception takes place. You can use it to hack the system: count the time period in which the response comes and find out which starting symbols work out for the password.
